# 🏠 Wohnungssuche: Familie Zaporozhets

This project is a professional landing page designed to streamline the apartment hunting process in Germany (specifically the Forchheim/Bavaria region). It serves as a digital "Bewerbungsmappe" (application portfolio) to provide potential landlords with a structured and visually appealing introduction to our family.

**Live Demo:** [https://familie-zaporozhets.de](https://familie-zaporozhets.de)

In the competitive German real estate market, standing out is key. This website was built to:
- Present our family profile, including professional backgrounds and social proof, in a modern way.
- Centralize all necessary information for landlords, such as contact details and PDF applications.
- Demonstrate my technical skills as a developer through a real-world, practical application.
